# 4OptionTestEmulator
the main question is : <br>
<b>when you can use random to answer 4-option tests:</b> <br>
a resoult sample:
~~~xml
first test ( normal mode )
--posetives : 4671
--negetive : 5329

second test ( when you can remove on choice )
--posetives : 9992
--negetive : 8
~~~
<b>so:</b><br>
use random in normal mode -> no <br>
use random when you are sure 1 option is wrong -> yes <br>
use random when you are sure 2 option is wrong -> sure <br>
use random when you are sure 3 option is wrong -> :| <br>
<b>trust me its computer science ;)<b>

# test it yourself:
1. clone this repository 
2. simply run student_emulator.js
~~~bash
node student_emulator.js
~~~
